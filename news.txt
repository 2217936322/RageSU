Hello RageSU users!
I've pushed out the update 4.1, it adds back the legacy feature "Rotation sway" in an improved form.
Choke shot got an update too, now you can choke as many ticks as you like.
To turn it off, simply set it to 0.
However, as of now, sendpackets seems to have a bug. It may be that this feature
is not working as intended.

Make sure to check on this tab from time to time!
