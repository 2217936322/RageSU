Hello RageSU users!
With the update 1.0 on the 29th of April 2020, I proudly announce that RageSU
has been completely recoded.

Old features have been significantly improved, a complete new config system has been added,
you can share config codes to your friends so they can easily get your config!

Sadly, I doubt the pasting issue will end, this lua started small as a fun project,
but it blew up to the point where many people try to do something similar.
Due to that reason, RageSU will remain closed source for the next time.
It will be obfuscated, which can impact performance, if there is a way to release scripts
without releasing the source, I will use that way to boost the performance.

Take care and have fun!

Make sure to check on this tab from time to time!
