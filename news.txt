Hello BetterSync users!
I proudly announce the BetterSync v4.0 update.
With this update the lua is going to change it's direction a bit.
This lua is going to be an ragebot improving lua that has a slight focus on antiaim.
In consideration of this change, BetterSync will be renamed to RageSU.

Make sure to check on this tab from time to time!
