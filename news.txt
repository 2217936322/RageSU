Hello RageSU users!

Thanks a LOT for all the positive support, I just realized that RageSU is the
most viewed lua thread and I would like to thank every one of you. Originally starting
as a meme project, I learned alot about lua and improved myself.
We also are approved now so that's another big milestone that we reached now!
Again, thank you all so much for the support!

Take care and have fun!

Make sure to check on this tab from time to time!
