Hello RageSU users!

--- BREAKING NEWS ---
Later today there will be an update regarding config files and config codes.
The update will add file checksums but that has the cost that every config code or config file
that has been created since, will be lost.
Please take screenshots of your configs and recreate the configs using that after the update to
the version 5.0/1.5.
Thank you for your attention.
---------------------

With the update 1.0 on the 29th of April 2020, I proudly announce that RageSU
has been completely recoded.

Old features have been significantly improved, a complete new config system has been added,
you can share config codes to your friends so they can easily get your config!

Sadly, I doubt the pasting issue will end, this lua started small as a fun project,
but it blew up to the point where many people try to do something similar.
Due to that reason, RageSU will remain closed source for the next time.
It will be obfuscated, which can impact performance, if there is a way to release scripts
without releasing the source, I will use that way to boost the performance.

Thanks a LOT for all the positive support, I just realized that RageSU is the
most viewed lua thread and I would like to thank every one of you. Originally starting
as a meme project, I learned alot about lua and improved myself.
We also are approved now so that's another big milestone that we reached now!
Again, thank you all so much for the support!

Take care and have fun!
